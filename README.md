# horiseon_website_challenge

## Description

The code we received for this project was for a website; for a company called, Horiseon. At first glance, the code was overwhelming for me personally. I have never done coding before, aside from the coding I did for our Prework, this was the first time I worked on fixing/changing a code in a HTML and CSS file. After staring at the screen for a good hour, I decided to dive in, with my phone on the other hand I began doing research using Google. 

I figured what do I already know how to do? I know how to maneuver through a website! I clicked on the links on the top right corner of the website. I found little things like the website title missing, and one of the links not working properly. I added a title element and href attribute for the Search Engine Optimization.. The website now had a title and the search engine now worked! 

Now that I had the ball rolling, I really felt encouraged to keep going! Next, I searched for a proper Semantic HTML format to guide me on what codes went where, and what their purpose was to be in a specific spot on the HTML file. I found a pretty amazing article "7 Alternatives to the <div> HTML Tag", which I will link below. I felt alot more comfortable now, making changes and getting rid of majority of the <div> elements. There was alot of trial and error, as I was replacing the <div> tags I constantly kept saving my work and refreshing the website to ensure all functionality and appearance remained the same.

Atlast! I was done with the index.html part, I moved on to the style.css. I made a couple changes, not too many though, alot of the contents where dimensions of images.         After making all those changes, the code for the index.html file now has more structure. It is definitely alot easier to read, and I personally feel like it follows the Semantic HTML format.  

During this whole process, I did my best to stay positive, and focused on how to improve the code for my client. I was able to relate to the needs of my client, because I too, was using the internet to get the best results for my code.

This website is all about targetting the right audience, making sure you get quick and accurate information from any businesses out there. Think of your business want and needs like a shoe size, not everyone will fit it, but your brand will stand out to those who are suitted for your business!
